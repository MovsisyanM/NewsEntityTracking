This, as well as the assurances given by the authorities that they intend to conduct and conclude an impartial and credible investigation into these events and the circumstances that led to them, in line with the demands of the Assembly, is a clear indication of the willingness of the authorities to overcome the political crisis and its consequences, and to turn to a new page in Armenia’s democratic development,” says the 15th point of the Resolution 1677 adopted by the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly on the functioning of democratic institutions in Armenia. In the document the Assembly particularly points out that it considers that the demands and recommendations contained in its earlier Resolutions 1609 (2008), 1620 (2008) and 1643 (2009) form a concrete and realistic roadmap to resolve the political crisis that ensued in Armenia after the Presidential election in February 2008.
